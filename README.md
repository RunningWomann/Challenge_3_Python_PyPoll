# Challenge_3_Python_PyPoll
Created a Python script to analyze the poll dataset called election_data.csv, which is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". Each of the following were calculated:

1. The total number of votes cast

2. A complete list of candidates who received votes

3. The percentage of votes each candidate won

4. The total number of votes each candidate won

5. The winner of the election based on popular vote.
